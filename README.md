## What is Lobash?

Due to its complex syntaxes with symbols, and Unix commands are different in platforms such like BSD and GNU utilities
have different options and behaviors with same command name,
Bash script development is complex and fallible.

Javascript has a powerful library [Lodash](https://github.com/lodash/lodash) for simplifying development.
So I build Lobash to do similar works for shell development.

Lobash is a library not a command. It provides collections of functions to improve efficiency of shell development,
and make it compatible with Bash 4.0+ and MacOS/Linux/Alpine/Busybox systems.

## Lobash Features

- Modular and easy to use. One module one Function.
- Rich Functions. Over [110+ modules][module-usages] provided.
- Robust and Safe. Over [600+ test cases](./tests/modules/) tested.
- Fast. 0.058s to load Lobash completely.
- Compatible with MacOS/Linux/Alpine/Busybox systems.
- Compatible with Bash 4.0 and higher versions.

## Build Status

- [Test Branch](https://github.com/adoyle-h/lobash/tree/test): [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/adoyle-h/lobash.svg?branch=test)][travis repo]
- [v0.4.0](https://github.com/adoyle-h/lobash/tree/v0.4.0): [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/adoyle-h/lobash.svg?branch=v0.4.0)][travis repo]

|    ‚úÖüí¨   | Bash     | v4.0          | -                                             |

Most Lobash modules support Bash 4.0+. See [module usages](./doc/module-usages/README.md#not-compatible) to find what modules not compatible with Bash 4.0.

‚úÖüí¨ means Lobash can be used but not all features supported in shell.
It will print notes to show what modules is not supported and it will be ignored when building Lobash file.

**If you want use Lobash with Bash 4.3 and lower versions.**
**Please read [./doc/with-lower-version-bash.md](./doc/with-lower-version-bash.md) first.**

**Lobash not test with Bash 4.0 in MacOS. It seems a bug of Bash 4.0 in MacOS. Please contact me if you solved this problem.** See [this document](./doc/with-lower-version-bash.md#not-test-with-bash-40-in-macos).

Although most Linux distributions use Bash v4.3, and MacOS not installed Bash v4 by default,
it is easily to upgrade Bash 4.4+ in most systems.

### Dependencies

Make sure below dependencies have been installed.

- Linux commands:
  - sed/grep/mktemp/dirname/basename/cd/printf/echo/wc
  - sed: BSD and GNU are both supported

## Installation

Available Lobash versions refer to [Git Tags](https://github.com/adoyle-h/lobash/tags) which named like "vX.Y.Z".

```sh
VERSION=v0.4.1
# Download source codes
git clone --depth 1 --branch $VERSION https://github.com/adoyle-h/lobash.git
cd lobash
# This step is optional. Clone submodules only if you want to run test cases.
git submodule update --init --recursive --progress

# Copy it to somewhere in your path
sudo ln -s "$PWD/build" /usr/local/bin/lobash-gen
```

## Usage

`lobash-gen -h` show help.

### Build your lobash.bash

First, build your own `lobash.bash` file by `./build`.

```sh
# Interactive build process, import all Lobash modules
lobash-gen
# Generated Lobash file: <lobash-dir>/lobash.bash

# Or build Lobash to specific path
lobash-gen <target-path>
# Generated Lobash file: <target-path>
```

**See [./doc/build.md](./doc/build.md) for more details.**

### Edit your scripts and set shell options

All Lobash modules are written and tested with the shell options:

- `set -o errexit`
- `set -o nounset`
- `set -o pipefail`
- `shopt -s inherit_errexit`

If you do not understand the meanings of these shell options,
please read [this article](https://dougrichardson.org/2018/08/03/fail-fast-bash-scripting.html).

**Lobash not enable these options by default. Make sure the same shell options enabled before call Lobash functions in your scripts. Otherwise there may be unexpected behaviors with it.**

### Load lobash.bash in your scripts

Second, load your own `lobash.bash` file in your scripts and all Lobash functions will be imported to current shell environment.

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash

set -o errexit
set -o nounset
set -o pipefail
set -o errtrace  # You can remove this line if you do not use l.trap_error.
(shopt -p inherit_errexit &>/dev/null) && shopt -s inherit_errexit

# It will load all Lobash modules
source <path-to-lobash.bash>
# Call l.<module_name> when "lobash-gen"
l.ask 'Hello Lobash?'

# Call lobash.<module_name> when "lobash-gen -p lobash_"
# lobash_ask 'Hello Lobash?'
```

Load `lobash.bash` is fast, nearly 0.058s in fact.

```sh
time source ./dist/lobash.bash

real    0m0.058s
user    0m0.022s
sys     0m0.036s
```

### Module Usages

See available modules and categories in [config.example](./config.example).

See all module usages in [./doc/module-usages/][module-usages].

See all module examples in [./example/modules](./example/modules).

## Advanced Usages

### Export specific modules with config

`lobash-gen` will export all modules by default. You can export specific modules with `-c <config>` option.

```sh
cp config.example config
# The "config" file is ignored by git

# Edit config, set PREFIX, BASH_MIN_VERSION and modules for building

lobash-gen -c ./config
```

## Command

While Lobash is a library for development, it also provides a command `./bin/lobash`.

Enter `./bin/lobash` show help.

```sh
> ./bin/lobash

Usage:
  lobash [help|-h|--help]
  lobash mod <module_name> [<sub_command_args>]...
  lobash meta <module_name>

Sub-Command:
  help       Show help
  mod        Invoke a Lobash module
  mods       Show available module names
  meta       Query metadatas of Lobash module
  github     Open Lobash github page in your browser

Description:
The "lobash mod" command is only used for certain scenarios. Many modules not work as command.
```

### lobash meta

```sh
> ./bin/lobash meta normalize
Module: normalize
Usage: l.normalize <path>
Description:
  - Normalize the given path which can be an unexisted path.
  - Trailing `/` always be removed.
Dependent: split, join
Deprecated: false
Since: 0.1.0
Bash: 4.0
Status: tested
```

### lobash mod

Note: The "lobash mod" command is only used for certain scenarios. Many modules not work as command.

```sh
> ./bin/lobash mod ask 'Is it OK?'
Is it OK? ([Y]es/No)
YES
```

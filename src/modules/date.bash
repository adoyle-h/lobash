l.date() {
  # %(datefmt)T : Causes printf to output the date-time string resulting from using datefmt as a
  # format string for strftime(3). The corresponding argument is an integer representing the number
  # of seconds since the epoch. Two special argument values may be used: -1 represents the
  # current time, and -2 represents the time the shell was invoked. If no argument is specified,
  # conversion behaves as if -1 had been given. This is an exception to the usual printf behavior.
  printf "%($1)T\\n" "-1"

# Developer Certificate of Origin

The project uses a mechanism known as a Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) to manage process.

A DCO is a lightweight way for a developer to certify that they wrote or otherwise have the right
to submit code or documentation to a project. The way a developer does this is by adding
a Signed-off-by line to a commit. When they do this they are agreeing to the DCO.

The full text of the DCO can be found at https://developercertificate.org . It reads:

Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1

By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

(a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I
    have the right to submit it under the open source license
    indicated in the file; or

(b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
    of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
    license and I have the right under that license to submit that
    work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
    by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
    permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
    in the file; or

(c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
    person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified
    it.

(d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution
    are public and that a record of the contribution (including all
    personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is
    maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with
    this project or the open source license(s) involved.
```

If you are willing to agree to these terms, you just add a line to every git commit message:

```
Signed-off-by: Some Developer somedev@example.com
```

If you set your user.name and user.email as part of your git configuration,
you can sign your commit automatically with `git commit -sS`.

An example signed commit message might look like:

```
An example commit message

Signed-off-by: Some Developer somedev@example.com
```

If more than one person works on something itâ€™s possible for more than one person to sign off on it. For example,

```
An example commit message

Signed-off-by: Some Developer somedev@example.com
Signed-off-by: Another Developer anotherdev@example.com
```


See `git help commit`,

```
-s, --signoff
    Add Signed-off-by line by the committer at the end of the commit log message. The meaning of a signoff depends on the
    project, but it typically certifies that committer has the rights to submit this work under the same license and
    agrees to a Developer Certificate of Origin (see http://developercertificate.org/ for more information).

-S[<keyid>], --gpg-sign[=<keyid>]
    GPG-sign commits. The keyid argument is optional and defaults to the committer identity; if specified, it must be
    stuck to the option without a space.
```
